title: "Maven for Rubyists"

The least maven you need to know.

Maven is both a dependency management system and a build tool. In terms familiar to Rubyists, you might think of it as incorporating bundler and rake into one tool. Ruby or Java people could likely come out of the woodwork to explain to me why that analogy is not good, but in broad brushstrokes, I think it's a decent comparison.
