I think you can develop discipline. You can develop mental toughness. I think of it as a muscle, like any other muscle, and you develop it by using it.

Listening to the [Jocko Podcast](http://jockopodcast2.com/) the other day, Jocko answered a similar question by saying (paraphrased): How do you get up earlier? You... _get up earlier_. How do you stop eating sugar? You... _stop eating sugar_. How do you go to the gym/work out regularly? _Go to the gym and work out regularly_.

I think this is 100% true, but that doesn't change that for many folks, this is not _enough_ advice. They want a step, or steps. What do you do that first time you're tempted to quit? What do you tell yourself that first time (or second, or third) that you're tempted to get off the program? To _make an exception_? Is there a technique? Is there a way to get over that?

In one sense, I think it still does come back to Jocko's advice. The way to do a thing is to _do it_. They way to not do a thing is to _stop doing it_.

But.

There are things you can do that will help, I think. You need to change your mental associations. And I think you _can_ do this. I don't think it's magic; it's practical.

For example, if you overeat, and you _know_ you overeat, and you know you _shouldn't_ overeat, but you still do, it may seem as though you don't know how to stop doing this. You already know you shouldn't. You never seem to follow your own, internal, _knowing_ about this. One way of seeing this is that you still associate more pleasure with overeating than you do with the (potential) pleasure of losing weight or being healthier. You're associating more pain with _not eating as much as you want_, than you are with _being overweight or unhealthy_. If you can change this association, if you can value, and actually _feel pleasure_ from pushing your plate away before it's empty, and if you can begin to _feel the pain_ of the inevitable consequences of overeating _more_ than the temporal "pain" of not getting to eat all you want, you can stop overeating.

This type of thinking is not original to me. This is pure [Anthony Robbins](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/tonyrobbin147786.html), and I'm pretty sure that he would say it's not entirely original to him, either: he developed those ideas by combining ideas from other places, and applying them.

Another, somewhat related, way is to change the way you see yourself. There was [a study](http://www.ejcr.org/Curations-PDFs/Curations6/Patrick_Hagtvedt.pdf) done where they had a group of people tell themselves "I can't... [do whatever]", and then presented them with a temptation (a bunch of chocolate bar, for example). A different group was to tell themselves, repeatedly, "I don't ... [do whatever]," and then this group was presented with with the same chocolate. The study found that a much higher percentage of those who had told themselves "I _don't_ [do whatever]" resisted the temptation to have cookies.

So? So, telling yourself "I don't" is telling yourself something about your identity. Who you are. Saying "I can't" is simply making a statement about desires, or your willpower. The statement about _who you are_ is a much more powerful one, and the study suggests that it's much more effective. (See [the study](http://www.ejcr.org/Curations-PDFs/Curations6/Patrick_Hagtvedt.pdf) from the Journal of Consumer Research here, if you like.)

These things might sound hokey or corny. Listen. I am completely okay with you thinking I sound corny, _if_ I can get results. If I'm able to change my habits, and change my thinking, and change my life, why should I care that if someone rolls their eyes at the way it's done?

You shouldn't care either. Your life is too important to throw out valuable tools for changing it just because someone will think it's corny, hokey, cliche, or weird.
